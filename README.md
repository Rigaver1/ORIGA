## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from alibaba_1688_parser import Alibaba1688Parser

# Initialize parser
parser = Alibaba1688Parser(delay_between_requests=1.5)

# Scrape a single product
product_url = "https://detail.1688.com/offer/123456789.html"
product = parser.scrape_product(product_url)

if product:
    print(f"Product: {product.title}")
    print(f"Price: {product.price}")
    print(f"Supplier: {product.supplier_name}")

# Export results
parser.export_to_csv([product], "products.csv")
parser.export_to_json([product], "products.json")
```

### Cargo Manager Integration

```python
from cargo_manager_integration import CargoManagerProcessor

# Process for cargo management
processor = CargoManagerProcessor()
cargo_products = processor.convert_to_cargo_products([product])

# Export cargo-optimized data
processor.export_cargo_csv(cargo_products, "cargo_products.csv")

# Generate analysis report
report = processor.generate_cargo_report(cargo_products)
print(f"Average profit margin: {report['summary']['average_profit_margin']}")
```

### Bulk Processing

```python
# Load URLs from file
from alibaba_1688_parser import load_urls_from_file

urls = load_urls_from_file("product_urls.txt")
products = parser.scrape_products(urls)

# Process all for cargo management
cargo_products = processor.convert_to_cargo_products(products)
processor.export_cargo_csv(cargo_products)
```

## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize behavior:

```yaml
scraping:
  delay_between_requests: 1.5
  timeout: 30
  max_retries: 3

cargo_manager:
  default_currency: "CNY"
  profit_margin_threshold: 0.15
  risk_assessment: true

export:
  default_format: "csv"
  include_images: true
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Data Extraction

```python
# Extend the parser for custom fields
class CustomParser(Alibaba1688Parser):
    def extract_custom_field(self, html):
        # Your custom extraction logic
        return custom_data

parser = CustomParser()
```

### Proxy Support

```python
parser = Alibaba1688Parser()
parser.session.proxies = {
    'http': 'http://proxy:port',
    'https': 'https://proxy:port'
}
```

### Rate Limiting and Politeness

```python
# Respectful scraping
parser = Alibaba1688Parser(delay_between_requests=2.0)  # 2 second delay
```
